# Headphone Notification Disabler

By Alex Free

Headphone Notification Disabler allows you to turn off the [loud music notification](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-headphone-audio-level-features-iph64ac7296f/ios) Apple added in iOS 14.

This package has been tested on an iOS 15.7.3 iPhone 6S Plus jailbroken with [palera1n](https://github.com/palera1n/palera1n). It should work for any iOS version since 14.
